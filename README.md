Name Tag Production Using XPlanar System and Fibre Laser
This repository contains all the resources, code, and documentation for a project that demonstrates the production of name tags using an XPlanar system and a fibre laser. The project showcases the integration of advanced manufacturing technologies in a proof-of-concept Reconfigurable Manufacturing System (RMS).

Repository Structure
The repository is organised into four main folders, each dedicated to a specific phase of the project:

Engraving Experiments

Contains G-code files for engraving experiments.
Includes videos of engraving tests showcasing the use of the fibre laser.
Forming Experiments

Includes G-code files for bending and forming operations conducted on the name tags.
Contains videos documenting the forming experiments and their outcomes.
Fixture Design and Testing

SolidWorks files for the design of the fixture used in the manufacturing process.
G-code files for testing the fixture's functionality and compatibility.
Videos showing the testing and validation of the fixture.
Final System Testing

Resources for the final testing of the entire proof-of-concept RMS system.
Includes integrated G-code and videos demonstrating the complete system in operation.
Purpose
This project serves as a proof-of-concept for a modular, reconfigurable manufacturing setup capable of efficiently producing custom name tags. The use of XPlanar technology and fibre laser engraving highlights the flexibility and precision of modern manufacturing techniques.

How to Use
Navigate to the relevant folder based on the phase of the project you are interested in (Engraving, Forming, Fixture Design, or Final Testing).
Explore the G-code files, SolidWorks designs, and videos provided to understand the processes and results.
Use the G-code files directly in your CNC or laser systems if replicating the experiments.
